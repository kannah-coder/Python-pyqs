# 📝 Student Records – Python Practice Project

This project is a **beginner-friendly Python script** demonstrating concepts like:

* 📊 Basic arithmetic & averages
* 📁 File handling (read/write text files)
* 🔢 NumPy usage (mean, sorting arrays)
* 🐼 Pandas usage (DataFrame, groupby, filtering)

Great for learning **Python fundamentals, NumPy, and Pandas** in one place.

## 🚀 Features

1. Calculate average percentage of marks.
2. Store student details in a text file and read them back.
3. Use **NumPy** for mean and sorting.
4. Use **Pandas** for data grouping and filtering.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python student_records.py
```

Expected outputs:

* Average marks
* Average of given subjects
* File I/O demonstration
* NumPy mean & sorting
* Pandas groupby & filtering
